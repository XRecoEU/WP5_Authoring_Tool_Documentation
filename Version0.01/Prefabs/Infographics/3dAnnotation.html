            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The <strong>3d Annotation</strong> Prefab is designed to help users to place various user-specific
                annotations on their 3D models. These annotations can include images, videos, or ordanary text elements.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>3dAnnotationWithCanvas:</strong> Hold all your annotations and make it
                    possible to see this directly in the play view.</li>
                <li><strong>3dAnnotation:</strong> With this gameobject you can place the Annotations in a specific
                    position in 3D world.</li>
