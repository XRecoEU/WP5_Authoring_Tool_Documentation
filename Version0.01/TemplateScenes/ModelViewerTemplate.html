            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The <strong>ModelViewer Template Scene</strong> is designed to help users to get a closer look at certain
                3d models in a scene. This scene can be built as a desktop and mobile application.
            </p>

            <h2>Contents</h2>

            <h3>Scene Component or Prefabs inside the Scene</h3>
            <p>The template uses an <a href="../Prefabs/Cameras/OrbitCamera.html">Orbit Camera</a> for intuitive
                navigation around the 3D model. The camera supports mouse and touch controls for zooming, rotating, and
                panning.</p>

                <h3>Example 3D Model</h3>
            <p>An example 3D model is included in the scene. This model can be replaced with your own 3D assets. Simply
                import your model into the project and update the scene accordingly. Use the <a
                    href="../Scripts/ContentPlacementHelper.html">ContentPlacementHelper-Plugin</a> to place and
                manipulate the model as you like. </p>

            <h3>UI Text</h3>
            <p>The scene includes an <strong>UI Text Prefab</strong> which is designed to help users with displaying text on the screen. It concentrates all important settings for text in one place.
                Size and Position can be adjusted via the Transform Component, visit the <a
                    href="../Prefabs/Infographics/UiText.html">the UI Text Documentation</a> for more informations.</p>

            <h2>Setup Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the <strong>ModelViewer Template Scene</strong> in Unity.</li>
                <li>Replace the example 3D model with your own by dragging your model into the scene and aligning it as
                    needed.</li>
                <li>Customize the Ui Text by modifying the prefab instances.</li>
                <li>Adjust the Orbit Camera settings if necessary to match your desired interaction experience.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Customizing the Scene</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Replace Example Model:</strong> Delete the placeholder 3D model and add your own assets.
                    Ensure the model is scaled and positioned appropriately.</li>
                <li><strong>Camera Adjustments:</strong> Use the Inspector to fine-tune the Orbit Camera's zoom limits,
                    rotation speed, and other parameters.</li>
                <li><strong>Scene lightning:</strong> Use the light intensity scrollbar to select the perfect lightning
                    for your scene.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Best Practices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep your 3D model optimized for performance, especially for mobile and web platforms.</li>
                <li>Use annotations to highlight key features or provide additional context for your model.</li>
                <li>Test the scene on all target platforms to ensure consistent performance and usability.</li>
            </ul>
