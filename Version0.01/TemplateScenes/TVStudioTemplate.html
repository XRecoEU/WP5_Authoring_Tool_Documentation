            <p>The scene template creates a complete environment of a typical TV studio.

                In the hierarchy, you will find the individual stages and their associated plugins,
                which allow you to add new content. For a better understanding, take a look at the <a

            <h3>First Stage with Greenscreen video</h3>
            <p>On the first stage, you can insert a greenscreen, which will then be displayed on a stage with spotlights
                and two screens in the background.
                For detailed information on how to customize the greenscreen video, take a look the <a
