            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Infographics Template Scene</strong> is designed to help users create interactive and
                visually
                engaging 3D infographics for 2D screens, including mobile, PC and web platforms. This scene is
                pre-configured with essential components and serves as a starting point for your infographic projects.

            <h3>Orbit Camera</h3>
            <p>The template uses an <a href="../Prefabs/Cameras/OrbitCamera.html">Orbit Camera</a> for intuitive
                navigation around the 3D model. The camera supports mouse and touch controls for zooming, rotating, and
                panning.</p>

            <h3>Example 3D Model</h3>
            <p>An example 3D model is included in the scene. This model can be replaced with your own 3D assets. Simply
                import your model into the project and update the scene accordingly. Use the <a
                    href="../Scripts/ContentPlacementHelper.html">ContentPlacementHelper-Plugin</a> to place and
                manipulate the model as you like. </p>

            <h3>Annotation Prefabs</h3>
            <p>The scene includes example annotations as prefabs. These annotations can be linked to different parts of
                the 3D model to highlight key details. For detailed documentation on the annotations, visit the <a
                    href="../Prefabs/Infographics/3dAnnotation.html">Annotations Documentation</a>.</p>

            <h2>Setup Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the <strong>Infographics Template Scene</strong> in Unity.</li>
                <li>Replace the example 3D model with your own by dragging your model into the scene and aligning it as
                    needed.</li>
                <li>Customize the annotations by modifying the prefab instances or creating new ones.</li>
                <li>Adjust the Orbit Camera settings if necessary to match your desired interaction experience.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Customizing the Scene</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Replace Example Model:</strong> Delete the placeholder 3D model and add your own assets.
                    Ensure the model is scaled and positioned appropriately.</li>
                <li><strong>Modify Annotations:</strong> Edit the existing annotation prefabs or create new instances
                    for additional points of interest.</li>
                <li><strong>Camera Adjustments:</strong> Use the Inspector to fine-tune the Orbit Camera's zoom limits,
                    rotation speed, and other parameters.</li>
                <li><strong>Scene lightning:</strong> Use the light intensity scrollbar to select the perfect lightning
                    for your scene.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Best Practices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep your 3D model optimized for performance, especially for mobile and web platforms.</li>
                <li>Use annotations to highlight key features or provide additional context for your infographic.</li>
                <li>Test the scene on all target platforms to ensure consistent performance and usability.</li>
            </ul>
